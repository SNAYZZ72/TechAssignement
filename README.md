Tech Assessment Instructions:

You can share a public repo when you are done. Everything (!) will be judged by the CTO when reviewing the exercise (code, repo structure, etc).
We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle. Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:Size = 512x512
The only non-transparent pixels are within a circle
The colours of the badge give a "happy" feeling.

You can also create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
